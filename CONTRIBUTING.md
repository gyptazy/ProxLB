## Creating an Issue

If you encounter a bug, have a feature request, or have any suggestions, please create an issue in our GitHub repository. To create an issue:

1. **Go to the [Issues](https://github.com/gyptazy/proxlb/issues) section of the repository.**
2. **Click on the "New issue" button.**
3. **Select the appropriate issue template (Bug Report, Feature Request, or Custom Issue).**
4. **Provide a clear and descriptive title.**
5. **Fill out the necessary details in the issue template.** Provide as much detail as possible to help us understand and reproduce the issue or evaluate the feature request.

## Running Linting
Before submitting a pull request, ensure that your changes sucessfully perform the lintin. ProxLB uses [flake8] for running tests. Follow these steps to run tests locally:

1. **Install pytest if you haven't already:**
   ```sh
   pip install flake8
   ```

2. **Run the lintin:**
   ```sh
   python3 -m flake8 proxlb
   ```

Linting will also be performed for each PR. Therefore, it might make sense to test this before pushing locally.

## Running Tests

Before submitting a pull request, ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality. ProxLB uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for running tests. Follow these steps to run tests locally:

1. **Install pytest if you haven't already:**
   ```sh
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. **Run the tests:**
   ```sh
   pytest
   ```

Ensure all tests pass before submitting your changes.

## Add Changelogs
ProxLB uses the [Changelog Fragments Creator](https://github.com/gyptazy/changelog-fragments-creator) for creating the overall `CHANGELOG.md` file. This changelog file is being generated from the files placed in the https://github.com/gyptazy/ProxLB/tree/main/.changelogs/ directory. Each release is represented by its version number where additional yaml files are being placed and parsed by the CFC tool. Such files look like:

```
added:
  - Add option to rebalance by assigned VM resources to avoid overprovisioning. [#16]
```

Every PR should contain such a file describing the change to ensure this is also stated in the changelog file.
