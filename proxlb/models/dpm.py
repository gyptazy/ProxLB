The DPM (Dynamic Power Management) class is responsible for the dynamic management
of nodes within a Proxmox cluster, optimizing resource utilization by controlling
node power states based on specified schedules and conditions.

This class provides functionality for:
- Tracking and validating schedules for dynamic power management.
- Shutting down nodes that are underutilized or not needed.
- Starting up nodes using Wake-on-LAN (WOL) based on certain conditions.
- Ensuring that nodes are properly flagged for maintenance and startup/shutdown actions.

The DPM class can operate in different modes, such as static and automatic,

    Attributes:
        None directly defined for the class; instead, all actions are based on input data

    Methods:
        __init__(proxlb_data: Dict[str, Any]):

            Powers on nodes that are flagged for startup and are not in maintenance mode,
            leveraging Wake-on-LAN (WOL) functionality.

        dpm_validate_wol_mac(proxmox_api, node) -> None:
            Validates and retrieves the Wake-on-LAN (WOL) MAC address for a given node,
