## Introduction
ProxLB is an advanced load balancing solution specifically designed for Proxmox clusters, addressing the absence of a Dynamic Resource Scheduler (DRS) that is familiar to VMware users. As a third-party solution, ProxLB enhances the management and efficiency of Proxmox clusters by intelligently distributing workloads across available nodes. Workloads can be balanced by different times like the guest's memory, CPU or disk usage or their assignment to avoid overprovisioning and ensuring resources.

One of the key advantages of ProxLB is that it is fully open-source and free, making it accessible for anyone to use, modify, and contribute to. This ensures transparency and fosters community-driven improvements. ProxLB supports filtering and ignoring specific nodes and guests through configuration files and API calls, providing administrators with the flexibility to tailor the load balancing behavior to their specific needs.

A standout feature of ProxLB is its maintenance mode. When enabled, all guest workloads are automatically moved to other nodes within the cluster, ensuring that a node can be safely updated, rebooted, or undergo hardware maintenance without disrupting the overall cluster operation. Additionally, ProxLB supports both affinity and anti-affinity rules, allowing operators to group multiple guests to run together on the same node or ensure that certain guests do not run on the same node, depending on the cluster's node count. This feature is crucial for optimizing performance and maintaining high availability.

ProxLB can also return the best next node for guest placement, which can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines using tools like Ansible or Terraform. This capability streamlines the deployment process and ensures efficient resource utilization. Furthermore, ProxLB leverages the Proxmox API, including the entire ACL (Access Control List) system, for secure and efficient operation. Unlike some solutions, it does not require SSH access, enhancing security and simplifying configuration.

Overall, ProxLB significantly enhances resource management by intelligently distributing workloads, reducing downtime through its maintenance mode, and providing improved flexibility with affinity and anti-affinity rules. Its seamless integration with CI/CD tools and reliance on the Proxmox API make it a robust and secure solution for optimizing Proxmox cluster performance.

## How does it work?
ProxLB is a load-balancing system designed to optimize the distribution of virtual machines (VMs) and containers (CTs) across a cluster. It works by first gathering resource usage metrics from all nodes in the cluster through the Proxmox API. This includes detailed resource metrics for each VM and CT on every node. ProxLB then evaluates the difference between the maximum and minimum resource usage of the nodes, referred to as "Balanciness." If this difference exceeds a predefined threshold (which is configurable), the system initiates the rebalancing process.

Before starting any migrations, ProxLB validates that rebalancing actions are necessary and beneficial. Depending on the selected balancing mode — such as CPU, memory, or disk — it creates a balancing matrix. This matrix sorts the VMs by their maximum used or assigned resources, identifying the VM with the highest usage. ProxLB then places this VM on the node with the most free resources in the selected balancing type. This process runs recursively until the operator-defined Balanciness is achieved. Balancing can be defined for the used or max. assigned resources of VMs/CTs.

## Installation

### Requirements / Dependencies
* Python3.x
* proxmoxer
* requests
* urllib3
* pyyaml

The dependencies can simply be installed with `pip` by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Distribution packages, such like the provided `.deb` package will automatically resolve and install all required dependencies by using already packaged version from the distribution's repository.

### Debian Package

### RedHat Package

### Container / Docker

### Source

## Upgrading

### Upgrading from < 1.1.0
Upgrading ProxLB is not supported due to a fundamental redesign introduced in version 1.1.x. With this update, ProxLB transitioned from a monolithic application to a pure Python-style project, embracing a more modular and flexible architecture. This shift aimed to improve maintainability and extensibility while keeping up with modern development practices. Additionally, ProxLB moved away from traditional ini-style configuration files and adopted YAML for configuration management. This change simplifies configuration handling, reduces the need for extensive validation, and ensures better type casting, ultimately providing a more streamlined and user-friendly experience.

### Upgrading from >= 1.1.0
Uprading within the current stable versions, starting from 1.1.0, will be possible in all supported ways.

## Usage / Configuration
Running ProxLB is straightforward and versatile, as it only requires `Python3` and the `proxmoxer` library. This means ProxLB can be executed directly on a Proxmox node or on dedicated systems such as Debian, RedHat, or even FreeBSD, provided that the Proxmox API is accessible from the client running ProxLB. ProxLB can also run inside a Container - Docker or LXC - and is simply up to you.

### GUI Integration
<img align="left" src="https://cdn.gyptazy.com/images/proxlb-GUI-integration.jpg"/> ProxLB can also be accessed through the Proxmox Web UI by installing the optional `pve-proxmoxlb-service-ui` package, which depends on the proxlb package. For full Web UI integration, this package must be installed on all nodes within the cluster. Once installed, a new menu item - `Rebalancing`, appears in the cluster level under the HA section. Once installed, it offers two key functionalities:
* Rebalancing VM workloads
* Migrate VM workloads away from a defined node (e.g. maintenance preparation)

**Note:** This package is currently discontinued and will be readded at a later time. See also: [#44: How to install pve-proxmoxlb-service-ui package](https://github.com/gyptazy/ProxLB/issues/44).

### Proxmox HA Integration
Proxmox HA (High Availability) groups are designed to ensure that virtual machines (VMs) remain running within a Proxmox cluster. HA groups define specific rules for where VMs should be started or migrated in case of node failures, ensuring minimal downtime and automatic recovery.

However, when used in conjunction with ProxLB, the built-in load balancer for Proxmox, conflicts can arise. ProxLB operates with its own logic for workload distribution, taking into account affinity and anti-affinity rules. While it effectively balances guest workloads, it may re-shift and redistribute VMs in a way that does not align with HA group constraints, potentially leading to unsuitable placements.

Due to these conflicts, it is currently not recommended to use both HA groups and ProxLB simultaneously. The interaction between the two mechanisms can lead to unexpected behavior, where VMs might not adhere to HA group rules after being moved by ProxLB.

A solution to improve compatibility between HA groups and ProxLB is under evaluation, aiming to ensure that both features can work together without disrupting VM placement strategies.

## Affinity & Anti-Affinity Rules
ProxLB provides an advanced mechanism to define affinity and anti-affinity rules, enabling precise control over virtual machine (VM) placement. These rules help manage resource distribution, improve high availability configurations, and optimize performance within a Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) cluster. By leveraging Proxmox’s integrated access management, ProxLB ensures that users can only define and manage rules for guests they have permission to access.

ProxLB implements affinity and anti-affinity rules through a tag-based system within the Proxmox web interface. Each guest (virtual machine or container) can be assigned specific tags, which then dictate its placement behavior. This method maintains a streamlined and secure approach to managing VM relationships while preserving Proxmox’s inherent permission model.

### Affinity Rules
<img align="left" src="https://cdn.gyptazy.com/images/proxlb-affinity-rules.jpg"/> Affinity rules are used to group certain VMs together, ensuring that they run on the same host whenever possible. This can be beneficial for workloads requiring low-latency communication, such as clustered databases or application servers that frequently exchange data.

To define an affinity rule which keeps all guests assigned to this tag together on a node, users assign a tag with the prefix `plb_affinity_$TAG`:

#### Example for Screenshot
```
plb_affinity_talos
```

As a result, ProxLB will attempt to place all VMs with the `plb_affinity_web` tag on the same host (see also the attached screenshot with the same node).

### Anti-Affinity Rules
<img align="left" src="https://cdn.gyptazy.com/images/proxlb-anti-affinity-rules.jpg"/> Conversely, anti-affinity rules ensure that designated VMs do not run on the same physical host. This is particularly useful for high-availability setups, where redundancy is crucial. Ensuring that critical services are distributed across multiple hosts reduces the risk of a single point of failure.

To define an anti-affinity rule that ensures to not move systems within this group to the same node, users assign a tag with the prefix:

#### Example for Screenshot
```
plb_anti_affinity_ntp
```

As a result, ProxLB will try to place the VMs with the `plb_anti_affinity_ntp` tag on different hosts (see also the attached screenshot with the different nodes).

**Note:** While this ensures that ProxLB tries distribute these VMs across different physical hosts within the Proxmox cluster this may not always work. If you have more guests attached to the group than nodes in the cluster, we still need to run them anywhere. If this case occurs, the next one with the most free resources will be selected.

## Maintenance
<img src="https://cdn.gyptazy.com/images/proxlb-rebalancing-demo.gif"/>

The `maintenance_nodes` option allows operators to designate one or more Proxmox nodes for maintenance mode. When a node is set to maintenance, no new guest workloads will be assigned to it, and all existing workloads will be migrated to other available nodes within the cluster. This process ensures that (anti)-affinity rules and resource availability are respected, preventing disruptions while maintaining optimal performance across the infrastructure.
